<p>All members of the research group are required to agree with the <a href="/manual/coc">code of conduct</a>.</p>

<h1 id="Sullivan's-responsibilities">Clair’s Responsibilities</h1>

<p>As your PI, it is my responsibility to do a number of things.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Be supportive:</strong> to the best of my ability or connect you to the support 
you need. Universities are places of growth and challenge. I recognize that 
times will occasionally be dark or overwhelming. Throughout your group 
membership, I will match your dedication to your success with support to the 
best of my ability. When that is insufficient, I am also responsible for 
pointing you toward external resources and helping you to formulate a plan.</li>
  <li><strong>Pursue funding:</strong> to support our work on ambitious projects toward the 
missions of the group. If funding is going to lapse, I will provide fair 
warning.</li>
  <li><strong>Mentor:</strong> students in their path to becoming independent scientists. I will 
strive to help you ask questions, engage the scientific literature, and 
design scientific work.</li>
  <li><strong>Guide Research:</strong> in both large-scale and small-scale ways. I will help students 
to select PhD or Masters projects at the larger scale. At the smaller scale, 
I will help to guide short term progress toward those accomplishments.</li>
  <li><strong>Provide feedback:</strong> in a timely manner on your research work, research 
direction, written products, presentations, software design, data analysis, 
career goals, and anything else of relevance to our collaboration.</li>
  <li><strong>Run interference:</strong> so that students and staff can be protected from the 
bulk of administrative and paperwork responsibilities.</li>
  <li><strong>Sign stuff:</strong> On a related note, I’ll sign stuff when you need it signed. 
Just ask.</li>
  <li><strong>Help to define and enforce timelines:</strong> toward prompt completion of work. 
That is, while not all researchers want or need externally enforced deadlines 
and specifically defined goals, many thrive when periodic expectations drive 
them to complete work on schedule. Unless you prefer a hands-off approach, I 
expect to help you to define your goals and hold you responsible for them on 
a timeline that is feasible but ambitious.</li>
  <li><strong>Provide course guidance:</strong> so that students can pursue courses
that benefit their research while accomplishing college and 
departmental requirements.</li>
  <li><strong>Provide space and supplies:</strong> including a physical working space, 
furniture, necessary computational resources, and virtual resources such as 
software licenses.</li>
  <li><strong>Support conference travel:</strong> when funding is available and students have 
work to present, I feel strongly that students should be given the 
opportunity to travel to technical conferences both nationally and 
internationally.</li>
  <li><strong>Connect you to my network:</strong> whenever possible. I will connect students to 
my professional network when it may be helpful to students as they seek out 
external experts, additional mentors, summer internships, and careers.</li>
  <li><strong>Direct Publication Efforts:</strong> by helping group members to identify and pursue 
publication-worthy work, helping to write and edit manuscripts, and guiding 
the submission process.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="postdoc-responsibilities">Postdoc Responsibilities</h1>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Be present:</strong> I expect you to be accessible during normal working hours. 
Feel free to follow a schedule that works for you, work from home once in a 
while when you need to, and take breaks when you want to. But, by default, 
plan to come to the office during the daytime with regularity.  I won’t track 
your hours, but I will worry if I haven’t seen your face all week.</li>
  <li><strong>Be productive</strong> by writing papers and contributing to software toward the 
missions of the group, the advancement of science in your field, building 
your career, and expanding your expertise.</li>
  <li><strong>Provide expertise:</strong> I and my graduate students are relying on you to be an 
expert in your work and to share that expertise during collaboration. This 
may take the form of presenting at lab meetings, providing feedback to 
graduate students, or taking leadership in scholarly work.</li>
  <li><strong>Collaborate:</strong> I very much hope that you will involve other members of the 
research group (myself included) in the work that you do as a postdoc. We are 
ready to share our effort, support, expertise, feedback, and ideas.</li>
  <li><strong>Support:</strong> both graduate and undergraduate students by providing leadership 
in collaborative work.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="graduate-student-responsibilities">Graduate Student Responsibilities</h1>

<p>Students who are my advisees have many responsibilities to themselves, to me, and to one another.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stay in good standing:</strong> with the graduate school by meeting graduate 
school requirements, filling out paperwork on time, registering for classes 
on time, completing milestones satisfactorily, passing any qualifying exams,
and scheduling committee meetings annually.</li>
  <li><strong>Be responsible:</strong> for informing yourself about graduation requirements, 
departmental deadlines, career opportunities, and anything else that might 
impact your standing.</li>
  <li><strong>Have a plan:</strong> It is your responsibility to work with Clair to identify a 
research topic, identify research milestones and goals, plan your timeline 
toward progress, plan for conference submissions, prepare for manuscript 
submissions, prepare for your thesis proposals and defenses, etc. Get a 
calendar, consider a task manager, create a GANTT chart… whatever works for 
you. If at some point it seems like you don’t have a plan, I will suggest all 
of these things.</li>
  <li><strong>Be resourceful:</strong> toward your independence as a researcher. You should 
actively explore the literature in your field, seek out solutions to your 
challenges, study independently in order to fill gaps in your own knowledge, 
and take the initiative to <em>try things out</em> when you’re curious to see what 
happens.</li>
  <li><strong>Prioritize research:</strong> by dedicating time and attention to it as you would 
a job. Your research support is tied to your research duties just as a 
paycheck is tied to a job.</li>
  <li><strong>Graduate promptly:</strong> I expect MS students to take two years and PhD students to 
take less than five years to complete all requirements and thesis defenses. 
Of course there may be exceptions, but extenuating circumstances should be 
communicated well in advance. My role includes helping you to formulate a 
feasible thesis project. Yours, in turn, includes meeting the goals of that 
project or communicating when those deadlines are infeasible.</li>
  <li><strong>Submit weekly reports:</strong> these brief updates should note your completed 
progress, insights you’ve gained from reading, tables and charts you may have 
created, your plans for next week, any challenges to your progress, and 
anything else Clair should know to interpret your progress.</li>
  <li><strong>Communicate with Clair:</strong> regularly about your progress, your lack of 
progress, your challenges, your needs, your strengths, your weaknesses, and 
anything else that impacts my ability to support you in your pursuit of a 
graduate degree.</li>
  <li><strong>Communicate with your colleagues:</strong> regularly concerning relevant 
collaboration progress, challenges, and insights that impact the integrated 
success of the group.</li>
  <li><strong>Collaborate:</strong> with other members of the group. Group members should strive 
to work collaboratively with one another toward the 
<a href="/manual/mission">mission</a> rather than in competition.</li>
  <li><strong>Attend group meetings:</strong> these will take place as often as once a week and 
graduate students are expected to attend and regularly present their work 
within these meetings.</li>
  <li><strong>Be on time:</strong> to meetings, because to do otherwise signals disrespect to 
your colleagues. Consistent lateness will not be tolerated.</li>
  <li><strong>Be present:</strong> I expect you to be accessible during normal working hours.<br>
Feel free to follow a schedule that works for you, work from home once in a 
while when you need to, focus on coursework when that needs to take priority, 
read for exams, and take breaks when you want to. But, by default, plan to 
come to the office during the daytime with regularity.  I won’t track your 
hours, but I will worry if I haven’t seen your face all week.</li>
  <li><strong>Participate:</strong> actively in the university and the department, attending 
colloquia, workshops, and other professional, technical, and departmental 
events when they are relevant to your work and professional growth. Of 
course, participate within reason, as prioritizing research remains a key 
responsibility as well.</li>
  <li><strong>Ask questions:</strong> in talks, in meetings, and any time there is an 
opportunity.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following are not explicitly required, but are strongly encouraged.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Proactively apply:</strong> for fellowships, scholarships, and awards.</li>
  <li><strong>Mentor undergraduates:</strong> when they need leadership from you in order to be 
productive, contributing members of the research group.</li>
  <li><strong>Be involved:</strong> in professional societies, educational efforts, and other 
service activities that enrich your life as a scientist and improve your 
professional and technical network.</li>
</ul>
